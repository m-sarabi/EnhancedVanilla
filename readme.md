# Enhanced Vanilla Datapack

Enhanced Vanilla is a Minecraft datapack that adds new features to the game in a non-intrusive way. It improves the hunger and thirst mechanics, making them more realistic and challenging.

## Features
- Thirst:
    - There is now a thirst mechanic.
    - Players need to drink water regularly to stay hydrated.
    - Players will lose one thirst bar every 2 minutes.
    - If a player is completely dehydrated, they will start to lose health, and finally die from dehydration.
    - Eating certain foods (such as melon slices and stews) will hydrate the player, while eating some foods (such as rotten flesh or poisonous potatoes) will dehydrate the player.
- Hunger:
    - Players will passively lose hunger very slowly, even when standing still (from full saturation to empty stomach in roughly 2 Minecraft weeks)

## Installation
1. Download the datapack from the [releases](https://github.com/EnhancedVanilla/EnhancedVanilla/releases) page.
